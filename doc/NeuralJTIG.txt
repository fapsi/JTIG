LTIG DL parser

if nodes are word embedding vectors, then, can we learn LTIG trees in a similar way as I do grammar extraction ?


Neural LTIG Parser:

Use JTIG to parse sentences and to get derived trees
These trees record in which order inference rules have been applied
In case of multiple parses, use original tree bank to get best parse tree
in this way JTIG can be used to generate treebanks which are annotated with LTIG derivations

Use them to create linearized forms of LTIG derivations in form of 
sequence of words and derivations between them
were the words are pointers to the elementary LTIG

Question: Can I use this to get annotated data also for ngram parsers as well ?
