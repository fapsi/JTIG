LTIG grammar extraction implementieren:

dependency treebanks to constituent trees
constituent trees extraction

or

directly create LTIGs from dependency treebank

Note:
the grammars I extracted so far seem to have low quality, because they overgenerate too much

NOTE:
I could also try to parse AMR based on dependency tree input
