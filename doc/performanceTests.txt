To-do:

define simple test method for running single sentence with selected dictionary.
- cf.: parser.core.ParserTests.parser.core.TestCorpus
- traverses a file of sentences and calls parser with given lexicon
-> DONE



check how to speed up parsing.
- check current performance
- basically, how to make sure to compute n-best readings only
- linear parsing



Performance test, 13th July, 2017

running JTIG with grammar which has beeen extracted from first 5000 sentences of conll 2009 version of PTB

run it on all 39.832 sentences from conll corpus

using parsing level forest


NOTE: 
Since grammar is lexicalized and only processed for first 5000 sentences of
PTB, we do not expect high coverage.

From sentence 5164: 
- basically no results
- clear because grammar only for first 5000 sentences

Running with max = 40

- 40258839 msec = 11, 18hours
- 1011 msec / sentence

- 39833 sentences
- 3857 > 40 tokens & skipped
