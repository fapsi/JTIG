To-do:

define simple test method for running single sentence with selected dictionary.
- cf.: parser.core.ParserTests.testLexicon_234_pt2().run

Output dependency trees in conll format

eventually define as read-eval-print-loop

First, check how to speed up parsing.
- check current performance
- basically, how to make sure to the compute n-best readings only
- linear parsing

Integration of GNTagger

Then, extract/load grammars
