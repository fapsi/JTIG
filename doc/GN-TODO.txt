To-do:

define simple test method for running single sentence with selected dictionary.
- cf.: parser.core.ParserTests.parser.core.TestCorpus

- traverses a file of sentences and calls parser with given lexicon

Output dependency trees in conll format

eventually define as read-eval-print-loop

First, check how to speed up parsing.
- check current performance
- basically, how to make sure to compute n-best readings only
- linear parsing

Output only lexical level for super tagging parsing

Integration of GNTagger

Then, extract/load grammars

Apply Deep learning
